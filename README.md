# practice-handling-missing-data

Please check out my [blog post](https://medium.com/@ntran19/practice-handling-missing-data-d820e0a6695e) for this "project"!

## data

You can find the [Iowa Housing](https://www.kaggle.com/emurphy/ames-iowa-housing-prices-dataset) data in the data folder. Please note that I renamed the .csv files from train1.csv to Iowa_Housing_1.csv and from test1.csv to Iowa_Housing_2.csv.

## notebook

You can find my main Jupyter Notebook (named Practice\_Handling\_Missing_Data.ipynb) in the notebook folder. I tried to document it well enough so you can easily go through my thought process.

## plots

You can find the output plots from the main Jupyter Notebook in the plots folder.

## src

You can find my source code in the src folder. The directories folder contains code to change directories. The models folder contains code to “compare the qualit\[ies] of diff\[e]rent approaches to missing values\[ and] reports the out-of-sample MAE score from a \[Random Forest].”
